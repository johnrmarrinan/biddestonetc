	<p>Junior Coaching runs on Saturday afternoons from 1 until 5pm. Juniors have to be members of the club to join a coaching class. The bookable court is available to others whilst junior coaching is in progress. Contact Lynne Gill (see below) to enquire about junior coaching.
	</p>
	<p> Members can organise individual or group coaching by emailing Roger Hurley (Roger.Hurley@hotmail.com) for men's coaching or Lynne Gill (any14tennis@hotmail.com) for ladies' and junior coaching.</p>

    <p>Members gain entry to the courts by entering the number provided with membership into the combination lock. </p>
    <p>Members also have access to the referee's loo in the Village Hall by using the key held in the floodlights box with a separate combination also provided with membership.</p>

    <br>
    <p>Members may book the single court up to 6 days in advance.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Note Winter League matches reserve the two floodlit courts on Monday evenings.</p>
    <p>One court is always available for members just to turn up and play regardless of bookings and league matches. If you are using this court and someone arrives to play next, you should finish your set and let the next party use the court.

    <br>
	<p>Floodlights can be used by purchasing tokens for Â£3 each to operate the lights on one court for half an hour.</p>
	<p>The latest time to start floodlit play is 9:30pm as the lights will not work past the 10pm curfew.</p>
	<p>Just inside the court area is a frame-mounted box in which there are payment machines for two courts. </p>
	<p>The lights go off automatically after half an hour, however five minutes before the lights are due to go out a light on the floodlight post will start flashing. At the end of your half hour, one floodlight will remain on for a further five minutes so that you can leave the court safely.</p>

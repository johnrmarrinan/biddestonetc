	<p>Membership runs for the calendar year. Members are provided with access codes for the courts (and the loos!) on receipt of subscription fee. Members are of course invited to join all club events.</p>
	<p>Categories of membership are:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Family</li>
  <li>Adult</li>
  <li>Junior</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Reduced subscription may be available if joining late in the year.</p>
  <p>Non members are allowed to play, provided EITHER they are playing as a guest of a member OR it is their first visit to a club night as a prospective member. There is guest fee of £2 payable to a committee member.

	<p>Members gain entry to the courts by entering the number provided with membership into the combination lock. Members may also gain access to the referee's loo in the Village Hall by accessing the key in the floodlights box using a separate combination number also provided with membership.</p>

    <p>Members may book the only the single court for 1 hour maximum. You may only book 6 days in advance.</p>
    
    <p>Floodlights can be used by purchasing tokens for £3 each to operate the lights on one court for half an hour. 
Just inside the court area is a frame-mounted box in which there are two token payment machines, one for each court. Simply insert your token in one of the slot boxes. The lights go off automatically after half an hour, however five minutes before the lights are due to go out a light on the floodlight post will start flashing. At the end of your half hour, a light will then remain on for a further five minutes so that you can leave the court safely. The latest time to start floodlit play is 9:30pm as the lights will not work past a 10pm curfew.</p>
